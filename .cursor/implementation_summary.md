# Multi-Provider Forex Strength Chart Implementation

## Overview
We've enhanced the Forex Pulse Check application to fetch data from three different providers and display currency strength comparisons in visual charts. This allows users to make more informed trading decisions by comparing data across multiple sources.

## Components Created/Modified

### 1. New Components
- **CurrencyStrengthChart.tsx**: A new component that renders a canvas-based chart showing currency strength for each provider.

### 2. Modified Components
- **ForexDashboard.tsx**: Updated to fetch and display provider comparison data in charts at the end of the dashboard.
- **TradeRecommendation.tsx**: Modified to display multiple trade recommendations in a collapsible interface.

### 3. Backend Changes
- **fetch-forex-data/index.ts**: Updated the Supabase Edge Function to fetch data from three providers:
  - Alpha Vantage (primary data source)
  - Finnhub
  - Twelve Data
- **20230528_provider_comparison.sql**: Added a new migration file to create the provider_comparison table.

## Data Flow
1. The Edge Function fetches data from all three providers when the user refreshes.
2. The data is stored in the provider_comparison table in the database.
3. ForexDashboard fetches this data and passes it to the CurrencyStrengthChart component.
4. Each provider's data is displayed in a separate chart using HTML5 Canvas.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Chart Rendering
The chart is rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API with the following features:
- Responsive width to fit the container
- Automatic scaling of the y-axis based on the data
- Color-coded bars (green for positive, red for negative)
- Grid lines and axis labels
- Provider attribution at the top

### API Integration
Each provider required different API endpoints and response parsing:
- **Alpha Vantage**: Uses FX_DAILY endpoint with USD as the base currency
- **Finnhub**: Uses forex/candle endpoint with OANDA provider and special symbol format
- **Twelve Data**: Uses time_series endpoint with USD/XXX pair format

### Caching Strategy
To avoid hitting API rate limits, we implemented caching:
- Cache duration: 1 hour
- Cache stored in memory (resets on function restart)
- Separate storage for comparison data

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Visual Comparison**: Users can now visually compare currency strength across providers.
2. **Multiple Recommendations**: Instead of a single pair, users see multiple pair options.
3. **Ranking System**: Pairs are ranked by entry quality with clear indicators.
4. **Collapsible Interface**: Users can expand/collapse trade details for better organization.

## Deployment
The deployment process is documented in the scratchpad.md file and involves:
1. Running SQL migration to create the new table
2. Deploying the updated Edge Function
3. Verifying the changes by refreshing the dashboard

## Potential Future Enhancements
- Add timestamp to charts to show when the data was last fetched
- Allow users to select timeframes (1-day, 1-week, 1-month)
- Implement consensus indicators that highlight when all providers agree
- Add provider-specific settings or custom API key configuration
- Enable downloading chart data as CSV for further analysis
